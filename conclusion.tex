\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

The protection of secure application from malicious OS and the sandbox of
untrusted application from benign OS on the PC are two relatively mature
research topics that have made substantial advances over the last decade.
However, how to remove the trust between the application and OS on both PC and
smartphone is still not fully explored.  Prior works also have limitations,
e.g., the granularity of protection and performance overhead. In this paper, we
discuss the evolution of prior works on the three problems.  More future works
are expected especially for smartphone and ARM-based server/cloud. Future cloud
computing framework should balance security, performance, cost and mobility.
