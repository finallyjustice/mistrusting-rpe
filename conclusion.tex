\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

The protection of secure application from malicious OS and the sandbox of
untrusted application from benign OS on the PC are two relatively mature
research topics that have made substantial advances over the last decade.
However, how to remove the trust between the application and OS on both PC and
smartphone is still not fully explored.  Many of prior works have limitations,
e.g., the environment switch generates nontrivial performance overhead. In this
paper, we discuss the evolution of prior works on the three problems.  More
future works are expected especially for smartphone and ARM-based server/cloud.
In the future, the design of cloud computing framework should balance security,
performance, cost and mobility.
