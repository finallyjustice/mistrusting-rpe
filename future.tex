\section{Future Work}
\label{sec:future}

Most prior works on PC are based on x86 architecture, e.g., Intel and AMD. x86
based servers are not energy efficient. To handle hundreds of millions of users
and their associated transactions, companies such as Amazon, Facebook, and
Google run immense data centers with until-recently unimaginable computation and
storage capacities. As online services become pervasive, projections indicate
that electricity consumed in global data centers worldwide in 2010 is more than
200B KWh, between 1.1\% and 1.5\% of worldwide electricity use \cite{times}. Three years ago,
Google announced that their facilities have a continuous electricity usage
equivalent to powering 200,000 homes \cite{nytimes-google}.Therefore, it is promising to replace x86
with ARM architecture to build the next generation of servers in the cloud.
There are already many ARM development boards published, such as Raspberry Pi,
BeagleBone and Cubitruck. 

In the future, we want to explore the security problems on ARM architecture.
Although prior works such as TLR \cite{TLR}, VeriUI \cite{VeriUI} and TrustUI
\cite{TrustUI} use security features of ARM, they are designed especially for
smartphones. We propose the first solution to execute the secure PAL on ARM
architecture both on a single server or in the cloud environment. Virtualization
can effective achieve the mutually memory isolation between application and OS.
However, currently the hardware virtualization extension is not supported by all
ARM CPUs.

Our proposal, as in Figure \ref{fig:future}, leverages the TrustZone, which is supported by most ARM CPUs, to
isolate the secure PAL in the secure world. The regular OS is running in the
normal world. The secure PAL is executed in the secure world. Unlikne
virtualization which can create more than one isolated environment, there is
only one secure world with TrustZone. To prevent the secure PAL of one
application from compromising the PAL of another, all PALs are sandboxed in the
secure world. We will use TrustZone to emulate the secure boot, late launch and
TPM operations. As ARM boards usually have limited resources, , the secure world
tiny kernel will not be loaded into memory unless the execution of PAL is
registered and triggered. To prevent Iago attack, we divide the system calls
into sensitive calls and non-sensitive calls. All sensitive calls, which can be
used by malicious OS to mount the Iago attack, will be handled directly by the
tiny kernel in secure world. Non-sensitive calls will be redirected to the
untrusted OS in normal world. As the tiny kernel is only responsible for
supporting the Micro-TPM, memory management and handling sensitive system call,
the TCB is small.
