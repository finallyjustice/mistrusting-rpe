\section{Future Work}
\label{sec:future}

Most prior works on PC are based on x86 architecture, e.g., Intel and AMD. x86
based servers are not energy efficient. To handle hundreds of millions of users
and their associated transactions, companies such as Amazon, Facebook, and
Google run immense data centers with until-recently unimaginable computation and
storage capacities. As online services become pervasive, projections indicate
that electricity consumed in global data centers worldwide in 2010 is more than
200B KWh, between 1.1\% and 1.5\% of worldwide electricity use. Three years ago,
Google announced that their facilities have a continuous electricity usage
equivalent to powering 200,000 homes.Therefore, it is promising to replace x86
with ARM architecture to build the next generation of servers in the cloud.
There are already many ARM development boards published, such as Raspberry Pi,
BeagleBone and Cubitruck. 

In the future, we want to explore the
security problems on ARM architecture. Although prior works such as TLR
\cite{TLR}, VeriUI \cite{VeriUI} and TrustUI \cite{TrustUI} use security
features of ARM, they are designed especially for smartphones. We propose the
first solution to execute the secure PAL on ARM architecture.
